# ðŸ„²ðŸ„² (Cartrack Coding Challenge App)

The **ðŸ„²ðŸ„²** app is my submission for the **Cartrack Coding Challenge**. The app was built using **Swift**. It follows the **MVVM** architecture and relies on **RxSwift+RxCocoa** for bindings on some view controllers.
I used both **CocoaPods** and **Swift Package Manager** to install the dependencies.
